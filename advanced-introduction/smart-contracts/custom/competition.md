# ðŸ¤¼â™€ Competition

Users can initiate a competition by deploying a Custom Escrow Smart Contract with [Automated Release](../automated/). They define the conditions of their deal, including the event to compete in, the rules, the entry fees, the participant count limit, and the deadlines.

Participants join the competition by sending their cryptocurrency contributions to the Smart Contract's address. These funds are securely held in Escrow until the outcome of the event is determined.

The Smart Contract integrates with reliable data sources or oracles to obtain the outcome of the event. For example, it may source data from APIs to verify results.

Once the event outcome is confirmed, the Smart Contract automatically calculates and distributes shares to the participants based on the predefined rules and the outcome. Shares can be distributed in proportion to the participants' contributions or according to specific rules set by the Smart Contract creator.

Users have the flexibility to customize the rules and parameters of the Smart Contract to suit various competition scenarios. This includes defining tiebreaker rules, handling refunds for cancelled events, and setting up multi-event accumulators.
