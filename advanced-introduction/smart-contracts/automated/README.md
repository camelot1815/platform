# ðŸ¤– Automated

Yes, this type of Escrow Smart Contract executes everything automatically.

Automated Escrow Smart Contract is pre-programmed with a set of predefined conditions and rules that govern the Escrow process. When these conditions are met, the contract automatically executes the next steps of the transaction without the need for manual intervention.

Automated Escrow Smart Contracts are ideal for straightforward peer-to-peer transactions where the conditions are clear and easily verifiable. For example, in a simple asset purchase, the contract might automatically release the Buyer's funds to the Seller upon confirmation of successful delivery.

## **Dispute Resolution**

Automated dispute resolution involves predefined rules and conditions programmed into the Escrow Smart Contract to automatically handle disputes without the need for human intervention.

When a dispute arises, the Smart Contract assesses the predefined conditions and evidence provided by all Parties. Based on these conditions, it automatically executes the resolution steps, which may include releasing funds, refunding assets, or taking other specified actions.

Automated dispute resolution provides a trustless, efficient, and tamper-proof way to handle disputes. It ensures that the terms of the Escrow agreement are strictly enforced without human bias.

This approach is most suitable for straightforward disputes with well-defined conditions. Complex disputes may require [human judgment and intervention](../manual/#dispute-resolution).
