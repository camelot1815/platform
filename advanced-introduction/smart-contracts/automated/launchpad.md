# ðŸš€ Launchpad

A Launchpad is a service that facilitates the safe and transparent launch of new cryptocurrencies by project teams or individuals. It acts as an intermediary layer between token issuers (projects) and potential token buyers or investors.

Only users who have completed [KYC verification](../../user-registration/kyc-verification.md) are eligible to initiate a launchpad.

## Implementation

The Platform assists in deploying the Smart Contract for the new token. It defines the rules and conditions of the token sale, including the sale start date, end date, token price, and distribution rules.

The Platform's core functionality comes into play during the token sale. It holds the funds invested by participants securely in Escrow until the predetermined conditions are met. This ensures that investors' funds are protected, and tokens are only released when the project fulfills its commitments.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Platform advises users to conduct thorough [due diligence](../../../resources/glossary.md#due-diligence) before participating in any Launchpad activities.
{% endhint %}

The Escrow release conditions for the project may include achieving certain milestones, hitting fundraising targets, or passing external audits. Once these conditions are met, the Escrow Smart Contract automatically facilitates the distribution of tokens to investors' wallets.

In cases where the project fails to meet its commitments or the sale is cancelled, the Escrow can initiate a refund process, returning investors' funds as per the agreed-upon terms.
