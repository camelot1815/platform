# ‚úç Manual

In contrast to an [Automated Smart Contract](../automated/), Manual Smart Contract provides users with more control and discretion over the Escrow process. The user can manually trigger specific actions within the contract, such as releasing or refunding funds, based on their own judgment.

Manual Escrow Smart Contracts are suitable for scenarios where the conditions of the transaction are not entirely straightforward or where users want to retain decision-making authority. For instance, in a freelance service agreement, the Parties involved may manually release payment once the work is completed to their satisfaction.

Manual Escrow Smart Contracts facilitate confidence between Parties by escalating the case to the [Dispute Resolution Authority](../../dispute-resolution/) in case of any issues that cannot be resolved through direct communication between the Parties.

## Use Cases

#### **P2P Trading of Fiat for Cryptocurrency**

Manual Escrow Smart Contracts are commonly used in [peer-to-peer](../../../resources/glossary.md#peer-to-peer) trades where the Parties want to exchange fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) for cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).

#### **High-Value Asset Sales**

For high-value [assets](../../../resources/glossary.md#assets) like real estate or luxury items, Manual Escrow Smart Contracts can be used to ensure that they change hands securely and that all Parties adhere to the terms of the sale.

#### **Cross-Border Transactions**

In international trade, Manual Escrow Smart Contracts can help mitigate currency exchange risks and ensure that goods are delivered as promised, especially when dealing with Parties in different countries.

#### **Service Agreements**

Manual Escrow Smart Contracts can be applied to service agreements, such as freelance contracts or consulting services. The funds are held in Escrow until the Seller delivers the agreed-upon service.

#### **Goods Delivery**

In e-commerce transactions, Manual Escrow Smart Contracts can hold payment until [the Buyer](../../../resources/glossary.md#buyer) receives and confirms the satisfactory delivery of physical goods, reducing the risk of [fraud](../../../resources/glossary.md#fraud).

#### **Complex Agreements**

Manual Escrow Smart Contracts are often used in [complex agreements](../custom/complex-agreement.md) to hold disputed funds until an agreement is reached, preventing any Party from accessing the funds prematurely.

## **Dispute Resolution**

### **Voting**

A voting system involves selecting a group of impartial users from the Platform's community to act as jurors and vote for a decision in dispute cases.

When a dispute occurs, all Parties present their evidence to the voters. Users review the evidence and vote on a decision. The majority vote determines the resolution of the dispute.

Voters provide a decentralized approach to dispute resolution, reducing the fees for Arbitration. It also involves the Platform's user community in governance.

### Arbitration

Arbitration involves the team of expert decision-makers employed by the Platform to handle and mediate disputes between users.

When a dispute arises, users can escalate the issue to the Platform's Arbitration. The Arbitration Team reviews the evidence provided by all Parties and makes a decision based on the Platform's Terms and Conditions. It has the authority to release funds, refund them, or take other appropriate actions to resolve the dispute.

Arbitration provides a centralized and readily available solution for dispute resolution. It can be especially effective for complicated cases.
