# ðŸ“œ Draft

A Draft Smart Contract is a preliminary version of a [Smart Contract](./) that outlines the Terms and Conditions of an [Escrow agreement](../crypto-escrow/) between two or more Parties. It serves as a template or initial proposal for the Escrow initiation.

A Draft Smart Contract is usually used for engagement with users in [Public Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow), but it can also be used to store a [Private Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#private-escrow) awaiting completion or signatures from all Parties involved.

A Smart Contract is considered a draft until the assets are transferred to Escrow.

The draft outlines the specific conditions that must be met for the assets to be released from Escrow. The draft's description may include a section detailing the [Dispute Resolution](../dispute-resolution/) process to be followed if there is a disagreement between the Parties. It may outline the process for making amendments or modifications to the Terms and Conditions in case all Parties agree to changes during the Escrow period.

While this is a Draft Smart Contract, it may include a preliminary version of the smart contract code that will be deployed on the blockchain. This code defines the logic for releasing assets based on the agreed-upon conditions.

Before the Draft Smart Contract becomes a finalized Escrow, all Parties review its Terms and Conditions. They must agree to these terms before the contract is deployed on the blockchain.
