---

# ðŸ“… Presale

The Platform is dedicated to creating fair and inclusive opportunities for users to invest in its native token through a multi-stage approach, including [Seed Sale](presale.md#seed-sale), [Private Sale](presale.md#private-sale), and [Public Sale](presale.md#public-sale). This commitment ensures that users of varying backgrounds and preferences have the chance to participate in the token sale according to their needs and preferences.

## Seed Sale

Seed Sale is the earliest stage of fundraising for The Platform. It involves selling tokens to a small group of private investors and angel investors. Seed Sale occurs at a very early stage of development. Its primary purpose is to secure initial capital for the Platform's development and testing. The tokens in a Seed Sale are sold at the lowest price with a **50% discount** and a price set at **$0.01 per token**. The total amount of tokens allocated for a Seed Sale is equal to **10% of the total supply (10 million tokens)**.

## Private Sale

The Private Sale occurs after the [Seed Sale](presale.md#seed-sale) and before the [Public Sale](presale.md#initial-coin-offering-ico). It involves selling tokens to a larger group of early investors, including institutional investors and community members. The goal of a Private Sale is to raise more capital, build community support, and create awareness before the Public Sale. Tokens in a Private Sale are offered at a lower price compared to the Public Sale but higher than the Seed Sale with a **25% discount** and a price set at **$0.015 per token**. The total amount of tokens allocated for a Private Sale is equal to **15% of the total supply (15 million tokens)**.

## Public Sale

The Public Sale is a fundraising stage where tokens are offered to a wider audience, including the general public. Public Sale aims to raise the majority of the Platform's funding and distribute tokens to a broad user base. It provides every user with the opportunity to invest at a rate of **$0.02 per token**. The total amount of tokens allocated for a Public Sale is equal to **20% of the total supply (20 million tokens).**
