# \* Native Token

A Native Token is a digital asset that is issued and operated within the Platform's ecosystem. It plays various roles in facilitating transactions, providing incentives, and ensuring a smooth operation of the Platform.

## Use Cases

### [**Escrow Services**](../smart-contracts/)

Tokens can be used as the primary medium of exchange within the Platform for the [assets](../../resources/glossary.md#assets) in Escrow. When Parties initiate a transaction, they deposit their cryptocurrency tokens into the Escrow Smart Contract. These tokens remain locked until the terms of the agreement are met, ensuring trust and security in the transaction.

### [**Platform Fees**](../platform-fees.md)

Users are required to pay fees for using the Platform's services. These fees can be nullified when using the Platform's Native Token. This is to encourage users to hold and use the Platform's Native Tokens.

### **Rewards and Bonuses**

Tokens can be used to incentivize desirable behaviours on the Platform, such as [referring new users](../user-registration/referral-system.md), [initiating staking](../smart-contracts/automated/staking.md), or [earning Reputation points](./#airdrops).

## Airdrops

Airdrop is a distribution of the Platform's Native Tokens to users who meet the mark of **2000** [**Reputation points**](../crypto-escrow/reputation.md) **or more**. Airdrops occur daily at **06:00 UTC** twice, separately for [Escrow Reputation](../crypto-escrow/) and [Voting Reputation](../dispute-resolution/voting.md#airdrops). Airdrop recipients are randomly selected from the pool of active users within the last _24 hours before the airdrop_. The number of tokens awarded in the airdrop is directly linked to the user's Reputation scores on the Platform. Upon successfully receiving an airdrop, users become ineligible for the subsequent airdrop and must wait for the distribution after that.
