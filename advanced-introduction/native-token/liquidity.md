# ðŸ’° Liquidity

Following the conclusion of the [Presale & ICO](presale.md) phase, The Platform will provide liquidity on various [decentralized](../../resources/glossary.md#decentralization) and [centralized](../../resources/glossary.md#centralization) exchanges. More precisely, **45%** of the overall funds collected during the Public Sale will be designated and secured as liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX), while another **55%** will be allocated to centralized exchanges (CEX).

### DEX or CEX?

[Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)](liquidity.md#decentralized-exchanges-dex) and [Centralized Exchanges (CEX)](liquidity.md#centralized-exchanges-cex) differ significantly in their operations and features. DEXs are known for their user-controlled, secure, and often more anonymous nature. Users trade directly from their wallets, reducing the risk of hacks, and enjoying greater privacy. However, DEXs can have lower liquidity and may not support as many tokens. Conversely, CEXs offer higher liquidity, faster trading, and a user-friendly experience but require users to trust the exchange with their funds and adhere to stricter regulations.

Utilizing both DEXs and CEXs provides a balanced approach. DEXs enhance security and decentralization, while CEXs offer liquidity and familiarity. This dual strategy accommodates a diverse user base, catering to those seeking more control and privacy, as well as those prioritizing liquidity and convenience.
