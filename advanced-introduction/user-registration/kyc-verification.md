# ðŸ‘“ KYC Verification

Users are strongly encouraged to verify their Know Your Customer (KYC) information on the Platform to ensure a seamless and unrestricted experience. Unverified users are going to have higher [fees](../platform-fees.md), as well as limited access and capabilities, primarily being confined to participating solely in [Private Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#private-escrow). Consequently, unverified users will not have the privilege to initiate or engage in [Public Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow).

KYC verification enhances the trustworthiness of the Platform by ensuring that users' identities are verified. This helps mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities and promotes a secure environment for all participants.

KYC-verified users gain access to the full spectrum of our Escrow services, including Public Escrow, which allows for a broader range of transactions and interactions with other users on the Platform. This access enables a more comprehensive and versatile user experience.



### Why Private Escrow is allowed?

Private Escrow transactions typically involve Parties who are mutually known and have established a level of trust or familiarity with each other. This trust can be based on prior interactions, relationships, or shared affiliations.

Because existing trust between the Parties is assumed, Private Escrow transactions often have a more streamlined process. Participants may not require the same level of verification and [due diligence](../../resources/glossary.md#due-diligence) that would be necessary in Public Escrow, where Parties are often strangers.

Users engaged in Private Escrow may prefer to keep their transactions confidential and limited to a select group of individuals they already know and trust. This ensures that sensitive financial dealings remain discreet.
