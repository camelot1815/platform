# üéÅ Referral System

A Referral System is a feature that incentivizes current users to introduce new users to the Platform and offers rewards for their successful referrals. This system is designed to encourage users to promote the Platform's services and expand its user base.

## Rules

To prevent potential misuse of the system, we have established specific rules that must be followed before users (the Referrals) can benefit from it:

1. The user being referred (the Referee) must [register](./) on the Platform using the referral link provided.
2. The Referee is required to complete the [KYC verification](kyc-verification.md) for their account.
3. The Referee must participate in at least one [Escrow transaction](../crypto-escrow/) after the verification process is successfully completed.
4. The Referrer earns profit in the [Platform's Native Token](../native-token/tokenomics.md) for each successfully completed and confirmed Escrow the Referee engages in.&#x20;
5. The token's amount earned is equal to the [Escrow amount proportional to the ranking system](referral-system.md#escrow-amount-proportional-to-the-ranking-system) and multiplied by the [coefficient proportional to the total Escrow amount accumulated](referral-system.md#coefficient-proportional-to-total-escrow-amount-accumulated).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The minimum withdrawal amount of the [Platform's Native Token](../native-token/tokenomics.md) equals **5$ or more**.
