# ðŸ¦¸â™‚ User Registration

By having users register and [connect wallets](../crypto-escrow/cross-chain.md), the Platform can associate transactions with specific individuals. This system helps enhance the security of the Platform and provides a level of accountability. As well as helping in [fraud](../../resources/glossary.md#fraud) prevention and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.

Registration allows users to set up security features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect their accounts. This extra layer of security helps safeguard users' funds and personal information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users are encouraged to provide identity documents to comply with [Know Your Customer (KYC)](kyc-verification.md) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Unverified users will be limited to only participating in [Private Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#private-escrow), so they can not initiate or engage in [Public Escrow](../crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow).
{% endhint %}

## Implementation

The user begins the registration process by accessing the Escrow Platform's website or mobile app and locating the "Sign Up" or "Register" option. The user will be asked to enter their full name, username and email address. Following the completion of the registration form, the user is directed to verify their email address.

As part of the registration process, users are presented with the Platform's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is essential for users to review and accept these policies, as they outline the rules and regulations governing platform usage and data handling.

Once the email is successfully verified, the user is prompted to enhance their user profile. Users may choose to add a profile picture and provide additional contact details.

Users are encouraged to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance the security of their accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection to their login process.

To prevent automated account creation by bots, the Platform uses an anti-bot verification process (e.g. CAPTCHA).

Following successful completion of the registration process, the user's account is created, and they gain access to the Platform's features and functionalities.
