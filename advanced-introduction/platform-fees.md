# â›½ Platform Fees

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following fees are not final and will be changed and updated prior to Public release.
{% endhint %}

## Escrow Initiation Fees

The main revenue stream for the Platform comes from Escrow initiation fees. When users initiate an Escrow, they are responsible for covering both the [blockchain](../resources/glossary.md#blockchain) gas fee and a commission fee charged by the Platform. This fee is required at the time the [Smart Contract](smart-contracts/) is created and is non-refundable.

{% hint style="success" %}
Escrow initiated using the [Platform's Native Token](native-token/) is commission-free for _verified_ users **(0% fee)**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Escrow Initiation fee is the same for all _non-verified_ users and equals **3% commission** even for the [Platform's Native Token](native-token/).
{% endhint %}

The transaction fee for all other tokens depends on the verified user's reputation. Current fee ranks are the following:

<table><thead><tr><th width="408">Escrow Reputation, points</th><th>Commission, %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>under or equal to 1,000</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>more than 1,000 and under or equal to 2,000</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>more than 2,000 and under or equal to 3,500</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>more than 3,500 and under or equal to 5,000</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>more than 5,000 and under or equal to 7,500</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>more than 7,500 and under or equal to 10,000</td><td>1.5</td></tr><tr><td>more than 10,000 and under or equal to 15,000</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>more than 15,000 and under or equal to 20,000</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>more than 20,000 and under or equal to 25,000</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>more than 25,000 and under or equal to 30,000</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>more than 30,000</td><td>1.0</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Public Escrow Participation

In order to engage in [Public Escrow](crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow), users must undergo [KYC verification](user-registration/kyc-verification.md) and initiate transactions with the existing Escrow Smart Contract. This transaction will involve only blockchain fees.

## Dispute Resolution Fees

Dispute Resolution Fees refer to the charges incurred by users when they engage in the Platform's dispute resolution process using [Arbitration](dispute-resolution/arbitration.md). These fees are based on the total Escrow amount in USD and currently equal to the following:

<table><thead><tr><th width="437.5">Total Escrow Amount, USD</th><th>Platform's Fee, USD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>under or equal to 100</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>more than 100 and under or equal to 250</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>more than 250 and under or equal to 500</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>more than 500 and under or equal to 1,000</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>more than 1,000 and under or equal to 2,500</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>more than 2,500 and under or equal to 10,000</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>more than 10,000 and under or equal to 25,000</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>more than 25,000 and under or equal to 100,000</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>more than 100,000</td><td>450</td></tr></tbody></table>
