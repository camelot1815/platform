description: How can Legal Authorities help to resolve a dispute?

# âš– Litigation

If the Parties do not agree on a solution provided by the [Arbitration Team](arbitration.md), the team's [Escalation Managers](arbitration.md#escalation-managers) involve the Legal Authorities that were mentioned in the Legal Contracts. This process is also known as **litigation**.

> Litigation is often considered a last resort in dispute resolution, as it can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. The Parties are encouraged to explore other resolution methods provided by the Platform before resorting to litigation.

Litigation is only possible if the Parties have signed a Legal Agreement prior to the Escrow creation. This agreement outlines the legal framework for dispute resolution and specifies the jurisdiction in which any legal proceedings will take place.

## Implementation

Upon going through litigation, the Parties involved typically seek legal counsel to understand their rights, obligations, and potential legal remedies under the applicable jurisdiction's laws.

The Party seeking to initiate litigation must file a legal complaint or take appropriate legal action according to the terms of the signed agreement. This typically involves contacting a lawyer, gathering evidence, and formally initiating legal proceedings in the agreed-upon jurisdiction.

Any of the Parties may choose to engage legal representation to present their cases in court effectively. This may include hiring attorneys or legal experts with experience in cryptocurrency-related disputes.

The dispute is presented before a court or legal authority, and all Parties have the opportunity to present their arguments, evidence, and witnesses. The court will evaluate the case based on applicable laws and regulations, as well as the terms of the signed legal agreement.

After considering all the evidence and arguments presented, the court issues a judgment or decision. This judgment may include orders for specific actions, such as releasing funds to one Party, refunding funds, or other remedies, depending on the merits of the case and the applicable laws.

Once a judgment is issued, it must be enforced. This may involve the court overseeing the execution of the judgment to ensure that the agreed-upon actions are carried out. In crypto-related disputes, this could include transferring cryptocurrency assets as ordered by the court.

The decision reached through litigation is typically final and legally binding, subject to the applicable laws and regulations. The Parties are obligated to comply with the court's orders.

#### Appeals

In some cases, either Party may have the option to appeal the court's decision if they believe there were errors in the judgment or if new evidence comes to light. The appeals process can extend the duration of the dispute resolution.
