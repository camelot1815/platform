# ðŸ‘€ Anonymity

Yes, you do. This is made possible by utilizing the best of both worlds. The Platform allows the users to act anonymously when initiating an [Escrow](./) between mutually known [Parties](../../resources/glossary.md#party). The Platform also acts as a matchmaking marketplace for [verified](../user-registration/kyc-verification.md) users, when it comes to matching with other Parties in a Public Escrow.

### Private Escrow

In a Private Escrow scenario, all prearranged Parties mutually agree to the Terms and Conditions of the [Smart Contract](../smart-contracts/) before it is created. The terms are typically discussed and negotiated among the Parties to ensure consensus and satisfaction.

Once all Parties are in agreement, the Smart Contract is created, and the assets are placed in Escrow. This step is carried out with all participants already determined.

### Public Escrow

Before initiating a Public Escrow a single Party specifies the Terms and Conditions of the Smart Contract, including the [assets](../../resources/glossary.md#assets) involved, the transaction details, and any other Escrow requirements.

To deploy a Smart Contract, this Party places its assets in Escrow for the amount as specified in the Terms and Conditions. The Platform then creates a listing which other Parties can match and immediately proceed to participate in Escrow. The Platform facilitates the matching process by pairing active users who have complementary listings or proposals.
