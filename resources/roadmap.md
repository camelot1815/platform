# ðŸ—º Roadmap

## Q3 2023 - Early Development (Pre-Alpha)

It is a crucial stage where the groundwork is laid for the successful development and launch of the Platform. This phase involves a series of essential tasks and activities to ensure that the Platform is well-prepared for its subsequent development, testing, and deployment.

### Whitepaper

It marks the initial step in the Platform's development journey. It involves the publication and distribution of the whitepaper, which serves as the foundation and blueprint for the entire project, outlining its purpose, objectives, technical specifications, and implementation plan.

The primary purpose of releasing a whitepaper is to provide detailed information about the project to potential stakeholders, including investors, developers, and the broader community. It aims to communicate the project's vision, innovative solutions, and the problems it intends to address.

### Demonstration

It is a significant milestone that involves showcasing the Platform's features, capabilities, and functionality to various stakeholders, including potential users, investors, and partners.

The demonstration offers a real-world preview of how the Platform operates, allowing stakeholders to see its key features in action. The demonstration validates the concepts and functionalities of the Platform by providing evidence of its feasibility and effectiveness in handling Escrow transactions.

### UI/UX Design

User Interface (UI) designers work on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that aligns with the Platform's branding and goals. Key aspects include designing layouts, buttons, icons, colour schemes, typography, and overall aesthetics.

User Experience (UX) designers concentrate on ensuring that the Platform provides an optimal user experience. This involves designing the navigation flow, user interactions, and overall usability. UX designers aim to make the platform intuitive and easy to navigate for users.

## Q4 2023 - Development (**Alpha Testing**)

The development team is actively working on publishing an initial Platform release, which during this phase is accessible exclusively to the team members and a select group within the community. This milestone marks a significant achievement on the path to successful project development and implementation.

### [Private Escrow](../advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#private-escrow) (Testnet)

This phase primarily emphasizes the core Escrow functionalities, including defining terms, depositing funds into Escrow, [resolving disputes](roadmap.md#arbitration), and releasing funds. It takes place on a [testnet environment](glossary.md#testnet) rather than the mainnet (live blockchain).

### [Arbitration](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/arbitration.md)

The Platform aims to create a primary [dispute resolution mechanism](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/) that relies on a team of in-house arbitration experts. Development during this phase will specifically address the technical aspects of arbitration, catering to basic disputes that may arise on the Platform.

## Q1 2024 - Private Release (**Beta Testing**)

This phase is characterized by the limited availability of the Platform to a select group of users or testers. It is not accessible to the general public during this stage.

### Mainnet Migration

In this phase, the Platform transitions its operations from a [testnet environment](glossary.md#testnet) to the primary [blockchain network](glossary.md#blockchain). This migration is a critical step in the Platform's development and signifies its readiness for full-scale, real-world use.

### Presale

During this phase, the Platform conducts a token sale event where these tokens are sold at a predetermined price to early backers. It is a significant milestone aimed at offering early access to the [Platform's Native Token](../advanced-introduction/native-token/) to a select group of investors or participants.

### [Referral System](../advanced-introduction/user-registration/referral-system.md)

The referral system includes developing the necessary software components and APIs to track referrals, user sign-ups, and rewards.

## Q2 2024 - Public Release (**Release Candidate Testing**)

During this phase, users interact with the Platform, create Escrow agreements, and conduct test transactions. They provide valuable feedback on the Platform's functionality, user experience, and any issues or bugs encountered.

### [Public Escrow](../advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow)

The Public Escrow feature offers users the capability to either initiate their own Escrow agreements or access existing listings established by other users. To facilitate this functionality, the development team aims to implement a matching algorithm for identifying suitable matches between individuals in search of complementary Escrow agreements.

### [KYC Verification](../advanced-introduction/user-registration/kyc-verification.md)

This stage is essential for ensuring the security and compliance of the Platform with regulatory requirements. During this phase, the development team focuses on incorporating KYC procedures that allow users to verify their identities and provide the necessary documentation to use the Platform's services.

### [Voting](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/voting.md)

During this phase, the Platform aims to enhance its dispute resolution mechanisms by implementing a community voting system. This system will enable community members to actively participate in the resolution of disputes by casting votes and contributing to the decision-making process.

## Q3 2024 - Stable Release

This phase represents the moment when the Platform is made available to the general public, offering its full range of features and services.

### [Complex Escrow](../advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/custom/complex-agreement.md)

In this phase, the Platform's development team introduces enhanced features for creating Escrows, particularly streamlining the conversion of any Legal Agreements into Smart Contracts with built-in [Litigation](roadmap.md#litigation) support.

### [Litigation](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/litigation.md)

Litigation is introduced to address complex disputes or disagreements that cannot be resolved through [voting](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/voting.md), [arbitration](../advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/arbitration.md), or other mechanisms within the Platform itself. It involves formally initiating legal proceedings or filing a case within the jurisdiction specified in the Legal agreement.

### Mobile/Desktop Native

During this phase, our central focus is on developing native mobile applications for both iOS and Android, ensuring they are user-friendly and feature-rich. In parallel, we will work to optimize the desktop application to make it responsive and intuitive. Our overarching goal is to offer a consistent user experience across mobile and desktop platforms.
