description: What is the benefit of Crypto Escrow over Traditional?

# ðŸ‘‘ The Platform

An Escrow Agent is a trusted [Third Party](resources/glossary.md#third-party) which holds and manages [assets](resources/glossary.md#assets) for multiple [Parties](resources/glossary.md#party) in the [agreement](resources/glossary.md#agreement). It makes sure everything goes smoothly by releasing the assets when certain conditions are met. It prevents [fraud](resources/glossary.md#fraud) by resolving any [disputes](resources/glossary.md#dispute) that arise.

### Traditional Escrow

The challenge with traditional Escrow Agents lies in their control over the funds of the Parties involved. In an ideal scenario, the Parties should have exclusive control over their funds. Utilizing cryptocurrencies for [Escrow](resources/glossary.md#escrow) addresses two issues simultaneously. It leverages the transparency and immutability of [blockchain](resources/glossary.md#blockchain) networks to secure assets while ensuring neither Party has [unilateral control](resources/glossary.md#unilateral-control) over the deposited funds.

## Key Features

### [Escrow Privacy](advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/anonymity.md)

The Platform provides an anonymous way to initiate an Escrow between the mutually known Parties in a [Private Escrow](advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#private-escrow). It is mandatory for users to complete [KYC verification](advanced-introduction/user-registration/kyc-verification.md) if they want to match with other Parties in a [Public Escrow](advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/anonymity.md#public-escrow). The Platform provides several benefits for verified users, including lower [fees](advanced-introduction/platform-fees.md), public [reputation](advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/reputation.md) and prioritized [dispute resolution](./#dispute-resolution).

### [**Smart Contracts**](advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/)

Users deploy [customizable](advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/custom/) Smart Contracts that define the Terms and Conditions of their agreement. These contracts create a trusted environment for securing assets, where users don't need to rely on the integrity of the Platform. Instead, they trust the code and the blockchain's [decentralized](resources/glossary.md#decentralization) nature to facilitate the transaction.

### [Cross-Chain **Operability**](advanced-introduction/crypto-escrow/cross-chain.md)

Users are free to use any [EVM-compatible](resources/glossary.md#ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) wallet, which becomes linked to their account upon successful [registration](advanced-introduction/user-registration/). They can engage in Escrow with different assets not only in a single [blockchain network](resources/glossary.md#blockchain) but also across multiple blockchain networks using [oracles](resources/glossary.md#oracle) supported by the Platform.

### [**Dispute Resolution**](advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/)

> It's essential to approach dispute resolution with the goal of reaching a mutually agreeable solution rather than focusing solely on determining right and wrong.

The Platform involves a [Community Voting](advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/voting.md) mechanism, as well as an [Arbitration Team](advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/arbitration.md) to address disputes between Parties impartially. If the Parties have signed a [Legal Agreement](advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/custom/complex-agreement.md) before initiating an Escrow, they can escalate the dispute to [Litigation](advanced-introduction/dispute-resolution/litigation.md).

### [Zero Fees](advanced-introduction/platform-fees.md)

The Platform charges a commission for providing Escrow services, but the users can use the Platform's services for free by completing [KYC verification](advanced-introduction/user-registration/kyc-verification.md) and utilizing the [Platform's Native Token](advanced-introduction/native-token/tokenomics.md).

### [Income Generation](advanced-introduction/user-registration/referral-system.md)

The Platform provides a [Referral System](advanced-introduction/user-registration/referral-system.md), which allows users to earn profit by enrolling their friends. [Staking](advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/automated/staking.md) is used by users to make passive income easily. Users can also participate in [competitions](advanced-introduction/smart-contracts/custom/competition.md) to make profits from their personal knowledge.
